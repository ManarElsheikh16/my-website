      Apple cake is a popular dessert produced with the main ingredient of
      apples. Such a cake is made through the process of slicing this sweet
      fruit to add fragrance to a plain cake base. Traditional apple cakes go a
      step further by including various spices such as nutmeg or cinnamon, which
      give a unique flavour. Upon the addition of spices the batter can also be
      accompanied by crushed nuts, the most popular being walnuts and almonds.
